# Programs.json
programs.json is the file that tells the Updater where the programs that need to be updated are located, the url to check for newer versions and path for local installed version.
```sh
{"url" : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jubskleiton/auto-updater/main/versions/latest_version.json", # url to the latest_version.json file
 "path" : "C://Program Files/Jubskleiton/Updater/", # the path to the program folder
  "program_name" : "jubskleiton_updater", # name of the program/custom_updater
   "program_extention" : ".exe"
   }
```
